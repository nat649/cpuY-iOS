# cpuY


cpuY is an app for ios (and probably android later) with no ads and free

but what is cpuY. cpuY is a app made for monitor your phone 

you can see: storage,RAM,and info about your phone,cpu AND NOW WITH WIDGET

developed on my macbook air from early 2015 with macos 15 
ia usage: cpu information why did i use ia for this: because it would take too long to search and put the correct thing and i still need to correct the ia writing

KEEPING THE APP FREE BABY

WARNING ask me first before doing a port/an aplication based on my code 
also if your app is made fully by ia dont use the name cpuY
